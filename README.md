This is a mock website, centered around rock climbing, I coded from scratch as a portfolio piece. 

It is the first time putting what I have learnt from a couple of online courses into action.

I used vue.js as the framework - but included as much functionality as I could without going overboard to gain experience in that area and practice my coding skills. The websiite makes use of Vue Router, Vuex, Firestore Database, Firestore Storage, Firestore Functions, as well as Vuetify, among other features.

I also included Stripe as a means to make payment for the Gear Shop I added to website. This works in conjunction with Firestore to create and store payments, and Stripe customer details.

No branches were used as I worked on this alone.

P.S. I realise my commit messages (or lack thereof) are not sufficient enough or in the correct format. Something I learnt after the fact.
