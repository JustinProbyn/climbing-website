    <p>
      Although the term “rock climbing” might suggest a singular discipline, the
      sport can be subdivided into three distinct practices. Most experienced
      climbers would define these as:
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>- Sport climbing</li>
      <li>- Bouldering</li>
      <li>- Traditional climbing</li>
    </ul>
    <br />Although it seems that everyone exclusively boulders today (a
    conclusion you might easily arrive at based on social media posts), the most
    popular form of climbing is likely still sport climbing. Most new climbers
    are introduced to the sport in gyms featuring roped climbing, many
    old-school climbers will continue clipping bolts forever...and then there’s
    everyone else in between.
    <br />
    <br />

    <strong>What it is</strong>
    <br />You hear the broad term sport climbing all the time, but its
    definition is quite specific.
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>
      <strong>Sport climbing:</strong>
    </em>
    <br />The act of climbing single- or multi-pitch routes, protected by
    permanently-fixed bolts and anchors drilled into the rock, using a rope and
    the aid of a belayer. The main difference between sport climbing and
    bouldering is the height of the routes being climbed and the form of
    protection (bouldering = no ropes, with crash pads). Likewise, traditional
    climbing calls for the use of temporary gear and anchors (ex. nuts,
    camalots, etc.) to protect the climber, as opposed to permanent ones used in
    sport climbing.

    <br />
    <strong>Before you go... &nbsp; find a mentor</strong>
    <br />This piece of advice applies to any form of rock climbing. As simple
    as climbing might seem, the technicalities and nuances are staggering. The
    best way to learn them is through the teachings of an experienced mentor.
    <br />
    <br />How are you supposed to find a person who can teach you how to tie
    knots, clean a sport climbing anchor, and clip quickdraws? Well, chances are
    you’re not coming in blind; you probably already know someone who has the
    skills––you just need to ask them. If you’re lucky enough to score some time
    from this person, make sure you pay extremely close attention to his/her
    advice, and take it to heart. It’s critical to familiarise yourself with the
    basics of gear handling and safety precautions before you start blindly up a
    cliff.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>How sport climbing works</strong>

    <br />Before you’re able to actually climb a sport route, the route needs to
    exist. A developer of a sport climb must first eye the potential line to be
    climbed. Next, s/he uses either a hand drill or a power drill (depending on
    local laws and regulations) to outfit the line with bolts and bolt hangers
    (read this post from Mountain Project for an overview of drill types and
    techniques).
    <br />
    <br />Many sport climbing areas feature single-pitch climbs. Generally, the
    term “pitch” refers to a route length that can be climbed and protected by a
    rope of average length, typically 60-70 meters. Multi-pitch sport climbs are
    common as well, especially in places with huge walls like Yosemite, and
    require the climber and belayer to climb the route pitch by pitch while
    anchored to the wall.
    <br />
    <br />The sport climbing process itself is relatively simple. A climber and
    a belayer tie into one end of a single rope, with a few meters of rope
    between them. As the climbers ascends the route, s/he clips into carabiners
    spaced intermittently up the wall, each of which act as anchors to protect
    the climber from falls. As the climber climbs, the belayer “feeds” her slack
    in the rope, and manually brakes any falls with the aid of a belay device.
    <br />
    <br />In the following sections, we’ll take a more in-depth look at the
    specifics of gear, climbing locations, and crag etiquette.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Nerd out on gear</strong>

    <br />There’s no shame in being a nerd. Especially when the subject of your
    nerdness is the equipment that will keep you alive. Since a full setup of
    all the gear below will set you back quite a bit of dough, consider going
    out with a friend/mentor before you drop a grand on shiny new stuff. You
    might also be able to find the following items used, but you run the risk of
    acquiring faulty and dangerous equipment. So be cautious.
    <br />

    <br />
    <div
      style="color: #d35400;"
    >Here’s a rundown of the basic gear you’ll need to start sport climbing:</div>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        - Harness: Invest in a comfortable and well-made harness, one that won’t
        completely cut off the circulation to your legs while you belay your
        friend or dangle from the face of the climb. You really can’t go wrong
        with Black Diamond or Camp harnesses.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Climbing shoes: Choose a pair of shoes that are comfortable and fit
        your foot, not the super aggressive bouldering shoes worn by your
        climbing hero. If your feet are uncomfortable, climbing will be
        uncomfortable! Evolv’s Defy, Five Ten’s Anasazi Moccasym, and La
        Sportiva’s Mythos are excellent first choices.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        - Rope: Go for durability with your first rope. A safe bet is a 70 meter
        length and 9.7 - 10 mm diameter. As the rope experiences normal wear,
        you can trim the ends and make the 70 meters last longer. The Bluewater
        Lightning Pro is a great introductory rope.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        - Quickdraws: A quickdraw consists of two non-locking carabiners
        attached by webbing. This is the device you clip your rope into as you
        climb, and allows for some extra distance between the anchor (the bolt
        and bolt hanger) and the rope to reduce rope drag. Though a bit on the
        pricier side, the Petzl Spirit Express is a superb quickdraw.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Belay device: It’s absolutely critical that you know the essentials of
        belaying––that means learning how to belay with a simple locking
        carabiner and ATC setup. This pairing requires the belayer to make a
        habit of manually catching the climber with his/her brake hand, which
        should become second-nature to you. Once you’ve mastered the classic
        belay setup, consider upgrading to a Petzl GriGri belay device, which
        has auto-locking capabilities.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Chalk bag: Pick a chalk bag that fits your hand easily and comes with
        a waist strap. Try out a FrictionLabs chalk bag! You’ll even get some
        free chalk with it ;)
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Pack: You need a spacious backpack to transport any and all of your
        sport climbing gear to the crag...and sometimes the hikes are long.
        Patagonia’s Crag Daddy 45L pack gets the job done.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <strong>Accessories</strong>
    <br />

    <div style="color: #d35400;">
      Here are a few supplemental items that you may want to add to your gear
      collection:
    </div>

    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        - Belay gloves: Protect your hands from rope burn while belaying. You
        can find fancy, expensive belay gloves for sale...but a hardy pair of
        leather gloves from the local hardware store work just fine.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Belay glasses: Save your neck from the strain of looking up at the
        climber while belaying. These contraptions use mirrors to angle your
        gaze upward. Y&Y Vertical make some of the best.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Helmet: Protect your dome! When hanging out and climbing at a cliff,
        you always run the risk of taking an awkward fall or suffering the wrath
        of a falling rock. Wearing a helmet while climbing and belaying is the
        easiest way to stay safe. The Black Diamond Half Dome is a great pick
        for your first helmet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <strong>Climb somewhere that makes sense</strong>

    <br />If you’re just starting out, the logical first step would be to learn
    how to sport climb in the gym. It’s safe, the bolts are closely spaced, and
    there are people all over the place to help you!
    <br />
    <br />But once you’re ready to get after it outside, there are a few
    considerations to keep in mind. The first is location––you might as well
    climb as close to home as possible (unless you’re psyched on an epic
    journey). The second consideration is the development of the area itself. I
    would recommend starting somewhere with a large base of developed moderates
    in the 5.8 - 5.10 range and a solid guidebook you can reference (and if the
    guidebook is unavailable, you can always check Mountain Project). See below
    for a list of areas that might fit the bill.
    <br />

    <br />

    <strong>Crag etiquette</strong>

    <br />The way we behave at climbing areas is an oft overlooked
    consideration. Rock climbing is a highly individualised pursuit, but that
    doesn’t mean we get to ignore the experience of others. Everyone is trying
    to enjoy the crag as much as everyone else.
    <br />
    <br />Here are some things to keep in mind when it comes to respecting the
    area and your fellow climbers:
    <ul>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Keep it quiet. Avoid yelling, screaming, and loud music. Many climbers
        enjoy the peace and quiet of the crag, and don’t want to hear your crew
        conversing loudly over techno beats. The crag is not the gym!
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Consolidate your mess. Sport climbing requires a ton of gear, most of
        which somehow finds its way onto the ground. Keep your belongings
        consolidated in one area, out of the way of paths and belay stations.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Trash sweep. Once you’re done packing up, sweep the area for trash. If
        you find something you left behind, pack it out. If you find something
        someone else left behind, pack it out as well. It’s our responsibility
        to keep our climbing areas clean.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        - Play nice. Remember that many developed climbing areas are super
        popular. If you hate sharing the crag, consider finding a different area
        off the beaten path. If you do find yourself at a busy climbing area,
        respect your fellow climbers––don’t rush anyone to climb faster, don’t
        crowd a belayer’s space, and don’t be mean. Be someone you’d like to
        climb around!
      </li>
    </ul>
